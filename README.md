The project is a simple facebook clone developed using Ruby on Rails. 


### Models, views, and controllers:

* User - this MVC is the model, view, and controller for the users, which is responsible for storing information about the user account and information
* Post - this MVC is the model, view, and controller for the status updates and wall posts that the users create
* Relationship - this MVC is the model, view, and controller responsible for keeping track of how many friends each user has. 
* 

##ATTENTION TA

##Implemented in this version:
  * Creating and Account and Logging In
  * Profile Preferences View
  * Profile Page
  * Search for Friend/Add Friend
  * Newsfeed View.


##Extra's not required by default specifications:

    * User Profile Pictures with Gravatar
    * Interests and Quotes Profile Section
    * Super Cool Background

##Testing Features:
  * Our Cucumber Tests should all be passing with the specified user stories
  * Most of our rspec tests are working. Some of them are not due to late changes to some of our models. We felt is was more important to have our app working then our Rspec tests working completely. 
*

SideNote: We have left some models/controllers in our app we do not use. These include: relationships controller and model, and micropost controller/model. We decided to leave this in to show the processes we went through create our app. We originally had thes implemented and then chose a different path to take. We replaced microposts with wallposts and relationships with friendships.
