##Testing Features:
  * Our Cucumber Tests should all be passing with the specified user stories
  * Most of our rspec tests are working. Some of them are not due to late changes to some of our models. We felt is was more important to have our app working then our Rspec tests working completely. 
*

SideNote: We have left some models/controllers in our app we do not use. These include: relationships controller and model, and micropost controller/model. We decided to leave this in to show the processes we went through create our app. We originally had thes implemented and then chose a different path to take. We replaced microposts with wallposts and relationships with friendships.
